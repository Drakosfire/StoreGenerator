#Store Generator
## Another DnD Tool from Drakosfire

This is a work in progress. I got about 80% of the way to rendering the the Chat GPT 4o generated store into a static html format. 
When a friend suggested a different format choice. 3 weeks later I'm writing JavaScript because I've decided what I want is a drag and drop DnD Page formatting tool. 
I've got the core functionality built in and am expanding blocks.
Next will be finishing the core block structure based off of The_Mirage_Emporium.html as the static iteration. 

All css in /dependencies comes from the incredible folk at https://github.com/naturalcrit/homebrewery/ as does the original formatting and a whole lot of inspiration. 

I've got my prior projects hosted at https://huggingface.co/TheDrakosfire, feel free to restart them, if you like em, hate em, leave feedback.
