#Store Generator
## Another DnD Tool from Drakosfire

This is a work in progress. I got about 80% of the way to rendering the the Chat GPT 4o generated store into a static html format. 
When a friend suggested a different format choice. 3 weeks later I'm writing JavaScript because I've decided what I want is a drag and drop DnD Page formatting tool. 
I've got the core functionality built in and am expanding blocks.
Currently pages are pretty janky and am working to fix.
Need more user feedback, loading bars. 

Future additions :
Gif of talking head for store keeper. 
Use a generated script for rolepplay interaction. 
Voiced output.
Whisper sync to handle user voice input. 



All css in /dependencies comes from the incredible folk at https://github.com/naturalcrit/homebrewery/ as does the original formatting and a whole lot of inspiration. 

I've got my prior projects hosted at https://huggingface.co/TheDrakosfire, feel free to restart them, if you like em, hate em, leave feedback.
